Sound good? Let’s get started. 

### Fundamental #1: Build Your Program around a Goal
The objective of any training program should be to help you reach your climbing goals.

Whether that’s climbing V10, 5.13, 5.11, or El Cap, a training program is only a good one if it helps you get there. What your goals are is up to you. The more specific your goals are, the better.

So what is your goal? And what should you be aiming at and accounting for when designing your training program? To make things a bit more concrete, let’s make up a hypothetical climber.

Let’s say this climber has a fairly open schedule where they can train any evening after work, has weekends free, and has access to a nice, modern climbing gym. As for their goal, they’ve bouldered V6 and want to climb their first 5.12c during this summer’s climbing season.

It is now summer and the season has begun. Their goal is to climb 5.12c and their local crag is in good condition this summer. We know that their schedule is fairly open, which means they can get outside on the weekends. Now, hopefully this climber has been training systematically over the past spring, but either way, it’s their performance season now.

This climber should make getting quality recovered days outside climbing their priority. At this point, time spent on their target route or on easier routes of a similar style that will help them build up to their goal is going to be far more valuable to them than fitting in an extra strength session on the weekend.

Some critical advice here is that _the goal has to stay the goal_. Too many people get sucked into chasing PRs on the hangboard or a heavier deadlift. Yes, stronger fingers and a stronger posterior chain are great and can be important steps to achieving your goals, but they are just that: means to an end.

You can start to get off track when reaching training goals takes precedence over your actual climbing goals. Are the conditions today perfect for your goal project? Probably better to head outside and put in some work. The campus board isn’t going anywhere.

_Keep the goal the goal_. Hanging a lot of weight on the hangboard is cool, but not as cool as sending your project.

So what are your goals?

--------
Homework Assignment

Start a training journal somewhere - in a notebook, on your computer, wherever - and write down your goals.

Go big! I mean, be realistic, but for this next YEAR, what are your goals? Be concrete about them and ask yourself these questions.

Where do you actually climb? What kind of time do you have to devote to climbing outside (or inside if your goals are in the gym)? Will you be going on a trip and you want to do a certain route or boulder there?

I’ve had people say to me that they currently climb 5.10d and they want to climb 5.13b this year but only have one day per week to train and climb. That’s just not realistic, so be honest with yourself. Here are some concrete examples of goals you can build a training program around:
- "I want to send V5 in Rocky Mountain National Park this summer."
- "I want to be able to onsight 5.11a in the 3 places I regularly climb outside."
- "I want to redpoint Tuna Town 5.12d in the Red River Gorge over a 10-day trip this fall."
Alright, it’s time to get to work!

Write it all down! and I’ll meet you here tomorrow with Fundamental #2: Target What’s Holding You Back from Your Goal.

### Fundamental #2: Target What’s Holding You Back from Your Goal

The key to designing a training program that’s going to help you reach your goals is to target what’s holding you back. Fingers aren’t strong enough for your project? Hit the hangboard.

Not powerful enough for the crux? Spend some time limit bouldering.

Always get pumped and fall after two bolts of climbing? Evaluate where you're at in dealing with the fear of falling, work your strength endurance, and spend more time route climbing.

Looking at a hypothetical climber who wants to send his/her first 5.12c, say he/she is failing because he/she just can’t seem to link the 2-bolt crux section together cleanly. He/She can do all the moves of the crux, but just can’t link them. Assuming he/she isn’t terrified climbing above a bolt, I’d say this seems to be a power/strength endurance issue.

If the climber is still going to have two evening gym sessions during the work week, it certainly makes sense for one of them to feature some high-end strength endurance work like bouldering intervals. Essentially, what any climber should be doing here is working backwards from targeting the weakness(es) to creating the training program.

The process should look like this: Take your goal, figure out what’s preventing you from reaching it, and target those weaknesses so you can turn them into strengths. Obviously, determining what is holding you back is easier said than done. I have three suggestions to help you do that.

1. Work with a coach. Sometimes it’s just way easier and more efficient to work with someone who does this for a living rather than do all the research and thinking for yourself. There are many climbing coaches out there, including those who work at your home gym and could see you in person.
2. If you don’t want to use a coach, use strategies like filming yourself or asking climbing partners for honest assessments to get feedback.
3. Be brutally honest in your self-evaluation.

--------------
Homework Assignment

Try to figure out what is holding you back from reaching your climbing goals. Write it in your training journal along with your goals.

Do whatever you need to do to find the answer to that, whether it’s talking to a coach, talking to your friends, watching videos of yourself climbing, or thinking it out by yourself. Either way, rehashing recent climbing failures and sussing out what made you fail will help you a lot right now.

### Training Fundamental #3: How to Structure Your Program

It’s important to remember that "periodization" simply refers to a system used to structure your training. While there are different types of periodization, we can simplify it by talking about linear and non-linear models:
- Linear: you go through different 4-8-week cycles where you focus on training one main thing - whether it be strength, strength endurance, power, or skill development. Once you’re done training that one thing, you move onto the next cycle and train the next thing.
- Non-Linear: you train multiple attributes at the same time but FOCUS more on one particular attribute for each cycle.

So that’s the difference.

I prefer to use a non-linear approach with my clients, and I actually wrote a complete bouldering training program based on this method, where all the workouts and all the training cycles are laid out for you so you don’t have to think about anything.

There’s quite a bit that goes into how many weeks each cycle should be, depending on your goals, what order you should do everything in, how many days a week, and what you should be doing during your sessions (more on that tomorrow).

I’ll lay that out for you as much as I can right now, but just know that if you decide you want help, my program is here for you, whether you’re a boulderer or a route climber who only has a bouldering wall to train on.

​

Structuring a Non-Linear Program

Here’s how I laid things out in my program and how I recommend you lay things out for yourself.

Keep in mind that you want to be honest with yourself about where you’re at in your training. You don’t want to go from never training before to training 4 days a week with 3 finger sessions per week.

That would likely lead to injury and burnout.

Also keep in mind that I almost never recommend that people train more than 4 days in a week.

​
​Program Cycle Durations for an Introductory Training Program

In Level 1 of my program (this is if you haven’t ever systematically trained before, or you’re getting back into it after a long break), the cycles are as follows:

12 Strength sessions
8 Skill Development sessions (deload period where you decrease training intensity)
12 Power sessions for a boulderer or Strength Endurance for a route climber
6 Maintenance sessions (during “performance” phase when you’re trying to send things)
There are a total of 32 sessions in all 3 training cycles combined. These are followed by a 6-session maintenance period that you can use during a “performance” phase when you’re trying to send things.

Here’s how long the complete program would take, depending on the number of sessions per week:

2 Sessions per week: 16 weeks
3 Sessions per week: 11 weeks
4 sessions per week: 8 weeks
As you become more and more adapted to the training and you start to see results, you can start to increase the sessions per week and/or increase the number of sessions in the cycles.

When you complete the program, you can start it over again, tweaking intensity, etc, or you can begin a new, ore intense program. 
​

Example Situations

Ok, so what should YOU do? Here are some examples of different situations climbers often find themselves in to get you thinking...

​
​Example Situation 1:

If you want to send a specific hard route in France in the fall and it’s still late winter, you have plenty of time to improve and move through all the cycles laid out above. This will almost guarantee that you’ll be stronger by the time you get to France.

Example Situation 2:

If your goal is to send a V6 in Hueco in 4 weeks and you’re currently stuck at V5, you’d want to get on a bunch of V6’s and hard V5’s at your home areas or the gym, and go through a 4-week strength cycle where you’re doing finger training, limit bouldering, and specific lifting to increase overall strength as quickly as possible.

Example Situation 3:

If your trip to the Red River Gorge is coming up in 3 months and you want to climb a specific route that is at your limit, you’d want to go through a strength cycle and then a strength endurance cycle before your trip.

This timeline is enough to make significant changes to your climbing.

In any case, you’ll then want to rest for at least a few days before your trip.

​
​Homework Assignment

Take a look at your goals, your time constraints, and the things that are holding you back from reaching your goals.

Answer these questions:

How much time do you have to train until your next performance phase?
How much time every week do you realistically have to train?
What is the one thing you need to focus on the most to improve your chances of reaching your goal?
Working backwards like that, try to make a plan for what you will be training and for how many weeks.

Tomorrow we’ll be talking about how to structure your sessions in Training Fundamental #4.

Until tomorrow,

Matt

P.S. If all of this is making your brain hurt, it’s because this stuff is complicated! It’s my job to make it simple for you, so if you’re a boulderer (or a route climber who only has a bouldering wall to train on), check out my Bouldering Training Program that’s all laid out for you, cycle by cycle and session by session. No more thinking involved.

Step 4: Structuring Your Training Sessions
Today we’ll be talking about the nuts and bolts of creating effective sessions, whether you’re training strength, power, endurance, or skills.

Let’s start with strength:
​

Effective Strength Sessions

Most of your strength training should be done by actually climbing, but here are the things you might imagine when you think of strength training off the wall:

Weight lifting (with plates, dumbbells, or kettlebells)
Suspension training (like with a TRX or gymnastics rings)
Hangboarding
Supplemental strength training is very effective at creating overall strength in a pretty short amount of time, and they’re what I use most often in my bouldering training program.

Well-rounded strength training is when you take exercises that cover the major human movement patterns and do them at a high-intensity , (say, 5 reps of each of them) taking adequate rest between the exercises, then repeat 2-3 times.

There’s a lot of creativity that can happen when choosing your exercises, but you want to try to include all of the following major movement patterns:

Pull (ex: pull-up)
Press (ex: push-up)
Hip Hinge (ex: kettlebell swing)
Squat (ex: weighted squat)
Core (ex: TRX plank)
Then there’s finger training, and there are LOTS of finger protocols out there.

Many protocols will help you, especially if you’ve never trained fingers before. You can combine a finger training session with a strength workout for a complete strength session.

​

Effective Power Sessions

Power is strength expressed with speed.

Think of it as the difference between being able to hold onto a crimp if you grab it slowly and being able to grab it when moving to it dynamically. Developing power is important for climbers as a lot of moves simply can’t be done statically.

One of the most effective power training methods is simply limit bouldering.

The goal here isn’t to send a lot of boulders, but to work on really hard moves because trying moves that are at your current limit level or slightly above your ability is how we build power.

You don’t need to even have the goal of sending boulders with limit bouldering: it’s all about just trying 3-5 moves at a time that are very hard for you.

This is just as effective for route climbers as it is for boulderers. In fact, one of the best things you can do for yourself as a route climber is to BOULDER!

​

Effective Endurance Sessions for Route Climbers

Endurance is our ability to maintain submaximal efforts for many moves at a time. I don’t normally include endurance work into boulderers’ training programs, but for route climbers, there are a couple different kinds of endurance to focus on: aerobic endurance and power endurance.

With aerobic endurance, you want to do sets of 3 or 4 routes that are approximately 2 number grades below your project goal for 3-4 sets. You should not get terminally pumped during this workout. The goal is instead to spend an extended period of time at an intensity right below your pump threshold.

For power endurance, I recommend bouldering intervals.

This is where you do 7-10 boulder problems at your flash level, 1 per minute, then rest for 5 minutes and repeat 2-3 times. So you’d start a timer, do a boulder problem, come down and rest for the remainder of 1 minute, then jump on another boulder when minute 2 starts, and so on.

Make sure the boulders are short enough that they only take 20-25 seconds to climb. The reason for this is that you don’t want the work side of the work:rest ratio to be longer than the rest. Boards like the Moon Board, Tension Board, or Kilter Board work well for this but you can always simply pick a “finish” hold on a set boulder to get the correct length boulder.

​

Effective Skill Sessions

Climbing isn’t a strength sport and it isn’t an endurance sport; it’s a skill sport. This means improving your climbing requires more than just getting stronger – you need to learn to climb better.

For skill drills, repetition is how we learn and ingrain techniques so that they become second nature over time. The more deliberate you can be in your practice of these drills the better.

Drills, however, aren’t magic pills. They will give you a framework for developing a toolset as a climber. Be ready to self-examine and be critical of your movement, abilities, and preferences. The more you put into them the more you’ll get out of them.

They are included in any good training program to help you add an element of deliberate practice into your training. For practice to be deliberate, it needs to contain the following elements:

Elements of Deliberate Practice

Intentional:

Each attempt/session with a drill should be done with a clear intention. The drill will provide a framework of what you should be focusing on, but don’t just settle for a surface level understanding. Keep the big picture of learning more efficient movement skills in mind.

Appropriate Difficulty:

For practice to be deliberate, we have to move outside our comfort zone. However, if the climbing is too hard, we can’t be intentional as our only focus becomes staying attached to the wall by any means necessary.

You’re not going to find the perfect difficulty every time and that’s ok, but shoot for a zone where the climbing is hard enough that it isn’t mindless but easy enough that you can focus on applying the intention of the drill. Your flash level is a good place to start.

Feedback:

It’s no secret that repetition is needed to acquire new skills. That said, just going through the motions doesn’t mean we’ll learn and improve. You need to be willing to try, fail, examine why, and then try and improve with that new understanding. Make sure you are getting feedback. Coaches and training partners are great for this, but seeing yourself climb is even better. Film your drills and review each attempt before the next one.

Willingness to Struggle:

By definition, getting outside your comfort zone is uncomfortable. The benefit of these drills is not in executing them perfectly – it’s in struggling to perform them in situations that challenge us. Be willing to fail and struggle through these drills. They might make you feel silly, self-conscious, or even embarrassed. Embrace those feelings. They are a good sign you’re on the right track.

I built this into my bouldering training program by incorporating movement drills into many of the sessions during the warm-up, and I highly recommend you do the same.

There are tons of climbing drills out there, but here are two examples to get you started:

One Touch: Climb 2 easy boulders, readjusting as little as possible with your hands. However you first hit the hold is how you use it. The real goal here is to practice being precise with your hands.

Quiet Feet: Climb 2 easy boulders making as little noise with your feet as possible. Focus on placing the point of your shoe deliberately on the best part of the foothold. The goal here is to practice being precise with your feet.

​

Homework Assignment

Alright, so now that you know what the sessions look like, you can build your plan!

If you’re doing a strength cycle, focus on strength sessions in that cycle, but don’t forget to also include the other parts of the equation into the program.

And remember you can combine these things on the same days sometimes. For example, you can do skill drills during your warm-up, and you can do a supplemental strength session after a limit bouldering session.

Be creative. Have fun with it. See what works and what doesn’t work.

With a little time and effort, you’ll have an effective climbing training program for yourself!

BUT if you are overwhelmed (and a LOT of people are overwhelmed by all of this) and you don’t want to make a plan for yourself, I totally get it. This stuff is hard.

And I’m here to help you out.

And just because we’re on the last day of the mini-course, don’t think you’re rid of me yet! I’ll be back with another bonus email tomorrow with something special for you, so stay tuned for that.

Until then,
