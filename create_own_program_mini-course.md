## The 4 Fundamentals of Building an Effective Climbing Training Program

The following section will discuss 4 fundamentals to enbale you to build your own training program. It will give you "homework" assignments for each section to get you started right away.

By the end of this mini-course--if you’ve done all the homework--you should have the beginnings of an effective climbing training program already created for yourself.

- Section 2: Target What’s Holding You Back from Reaching Your Goal
- Section 3: How to Structure Your Program
- Section 4: How to Structure Your Sessions

Sound good? Let’s get started. 

### Fundamental #1: Build Your Program around a Goal
The objective of any training program should be to help you reach your climbing goals.

Whether that’s climbing V10, 5.13, 5.11, or El Cap, a training program is only a good one if it helps you get there. What your goals are is up to you. The more specific your goals are, the better.

So what is your goal? And what should you be aiming at and accounting for when designing your training program?

To make things a bit more concrete, let’s make up a hypothetical climber.

Let’s say this climber has a fairly open schedule where they can train any evening after work, has weekends free, and has access to a nice, modern climbing gym. As for their goal, they’ve bouldered V6 and want to climb their first 5.12c during this summer’s climbing season.

It is now summer and the season has begun.

Their goal is to climb 5.12c and their local crag is in good condition this summer. We know that their schedule is fairly open, which means they can get outside on the weekends.

Now, hopefully this climber has been training systematically over the past spring, but either way, it’s their performance season now.

This climber should make getting quality recovered days outside climbing their priority.

At this point, time spent on their target route or on easier routes of a similar style that will help them build up to their goal is going to be far more valuable to them than fitting in an extra strength session on the weekend.

Some critical advice here is that the goal has to stay the goal. Too many people get sucked into chasing PRs on the hangboard or a heavier deadlift. Yes, stronger fingers and a stronger posterior chain are great and can be important steps to achieving your goals, but they are just that: means to an end.

You can start to get off track when reaching training goals takes precedence over your actual climbing goals.

Are the conditions today perfect for your goal project? Probably better to head outside and put in some work.

The campus board isn’t going anywhere.

Keep the goal the goal. Hanging a lot of weight on the hangboard is cool, but not as cool as sending your project.

So what are your goals?

​

Homework Assignment

Start a training journal somewhere - in a notebook, on your computer, wherever - and write down your goals.

Go big!

I mean, be realistic, but for this next YEAR, what are your goals? Be concrete about them and ask yourself these questions.

Where do you actually climb? What kind of time do you have to devote to climbing outside (or inside if your goals are in the gym)? Will you be going on a trip and you want to do a certain route or boulder there?

I’ve had people say to me that they currently climb 5.10d and they want to climb 5.13b this year but only have one day per week to train and climb.

That’s just not realistic, so be honest with yourself. Here are some concrete examples of goals you can build a training program around:

“I want to send V5 in Rocky Mountain National Park this summer.”
“I want to be able to onsight 5.11a in the 3 places I regularly climb outside.”
“I want to redpoint Tuna Town 5.12d in the Red River Gorge over a 10-day trip this fall.”
Alright, it’s time to get to work!

Write it all down and I’ll meet you here tomorrow with Fundamental #2: Target What’s Holding You Back from Your Goal.

Cheers,
